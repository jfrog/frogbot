Algorithm confusion in PyJWT leads to authentication bypass.

### 🔬 JFrog Research Details

**Description:**
[PyJWT](https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT) is a Python implementation of the RFC 7519 standard (JSON Web Tokens). [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) are an open, industry standard method for representing claims securely between two parties. A JWT comes with an inline signature that is meant to be verified by the receiving application. JWT supports multiple standard algorithms, and the algorithm itself is **specified in the JWT token itself**.

The PyJWT library uses the signature-verification algorithm that is specified in the JWT token (that is completely attacker-controlled), however - it requires the validating application to pass an `algorithms` kwarg that specifies the expected algorithms in order to avoid key confusion. Unfortunately -  a non-default value `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` exists that allows all algorithms.
The PyJWT library also tries to mitigate key confusions in this case, by making sure that public keys are not used as an HMAC secret. For example, HMAC secrets that begin with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` are rejected when encoding a JWT.

It has been discovered that due to missing key-type checks, in cases where -
1. The vulnerable application expects to receive a JWT signed with an Elliptic-Curve key (one of the algorithms `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`, `EdDSA`)
2. The vulnerable application decodes the JWT token using the non-default kwarg `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` (or alternatively, `algorithms` contain both an HMAC-based algorithm and an EC-based algorithm)

An attacker can create an HMAC-signed (ex. `HS256`) JWT token, using the (well-known!) EC public key as the HMAC key. The validating application will accept this JWT token as a valid token.

For example, an application might have planned to validate an `EdDSA`-signed token that was generated as follows -
```python
# Making a good jwt token that should work by signing it with the private key
encoded_good = jwt.encode({"test": 1234}, priv_key_bytes, algorithm="EdDSA")
```
A...

**Remediation:**
##### Development mitigations

Use a specific algorithm instead of `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms`.
For example, replace the following call - 
`jwt.decode(encoded_jwt, pub_key_bytes, algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms())`
With -
`jwt.decode(encoded_jwt, pub_key_bytes, algorithms=["ES256"])`

Lack of minimal key length in PyJWT may lead to authorization bypass

### 🔬 JFrog Research Details

**Description:**
It was discovered that PyJWT does not enforce any minimal key length when encoding JWT tokens.
For example, a user may encode and decode a JWT token successfully, even with an empty key -
```python
key = ''
e = jwt.encode({"foo":"bar"}, key, algorithm='HS256')
print(e)
>eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmb28iOiJiYXIifQ._NaFhGu8tCCgBKksGBA6ADwRdKx3e9GES_KyF4A5phE

jwt.decode(e, key, algorithms=['HS256'])
> {'foo': 'bar'}
```

Using a key with a short length may lead to attackers successfully brute-forcing it, leading to them being able to modify the contents of JWT tokens that use that key, possibly leading to privilege escalation and authorization bypass.

The vulnerability was disputed (and never fixed) since the maintainers claim that the key is chosen by the application that uses the library, and is responsible for choosing a sufficiently long key.
